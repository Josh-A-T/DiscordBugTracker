# Discord Bug Tracker and Fullstack App

This is an attempt to create a discord bot and associated application to track simple issues. Right now it consists of 3 parts
1. A Flask + TinyDB backend. This creates the API out Frontend will talk to
2. A Discord bot that does not exist. In the future users can use slash commands to file, track and update bug reports
3. A react + Vite frontend. This is how the developer will be able to track, update, comment and close bug reports. potentially also allowing users to comment after a reports been filed. Right now it is hard coded to pull from one test report that has two associated comments. 


This is the react frontend

live: coming soon
api live: coming soon

Do not install, barely works for me now. There is an attempt at documenting the API in src/docs/testing.html but its late.
